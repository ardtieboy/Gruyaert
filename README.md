# Gruyaert website

This is my first attempt to create and deploy a static website with Jekyll.

## Deploying

You can run the site locally with the command 'bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0'

You can deploy the site as well to github pages by pushing your changes to the master branch.

Note that in order to deploy to gh pages, you need to adapt the '_config.yml' file (base-url).

## Adding content

The site is built in a way that content can be added by adding .MD files in the correct folders.
Just follow the structure and upload images where needed.

## Forwarding

The site is also visible by visiting 'www.bouwonderneminggruyaert.be'. This is done in the config in combell in the section webforwarding.
